## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In his practice I used the background CSS properties.
For example:

- The `background-image` property sets one or more background images for an element.
- The `background-position` property sets the starting position of a background image.
- The `background-repeat` property sets if/how a background image will be repeated.
- The `background-size` property specifies the size of the background images.

```css
.image {
  background-image: url("image.jpg");
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
}
```

### Continued development

I had problems with svg images. I think I'll practice fixing those problems in future projects.
